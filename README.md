# Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is my third project in the Odin Project curriculum.
My target was to create a Rock Paper Scissors game, to be played on the console, by using Javascript.

Update: The revision of this project included the creation of a User Interface that let's the user play the game through click inputs.
